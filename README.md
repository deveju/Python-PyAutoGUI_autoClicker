## **Create a python auto-clicker!**
### â–£ Installing PyAutoGUI into Visual Studio Code:
- Open the Visual Studio Code terminal and type:
```bash
pip install pyautogui
```
- Wait for the installation to complete!
- If everything went right...
- The **PyAutoGUI** is successfully installed, to use, import it into your code!
```bash
import pyautogui as gui
```
##### **NOTE:** "as gui" is used to make the code smaller, instead of typing "pyautogui" every time, you can instead type "gui", it means you are importing it "as" "gui" instead of "pyautogui".
